# Image resizer

With a simple interface I can resize images, 2 times the size also from 1/2 to 1/32, and it shows you a reference image.
And with a button to save the resized image.


# How to use

When you press the button it opens the file explorer and you select an image

Buttons are locked until you select an image to avoid mistakes

Then you can select a size, show a preview
